Portable program to (eventually) work with the robot vacuum

The backstory on this is that my dent-and-scratch robot vacuum has been struggling a bit and I finally noticed the USB port.  I see one project that might be of some use in figuring out where the problem is ([NeatoControl](https://bitbucket.org/heXor/neatocontrol)), but that's not going to work on my Linux machine for a whole bunch of reasons.  So, this project will be an attempt to build a (probably simplified, since I only have one vacuum) somewhat comparable system that's either more portable or at least Linux-ready.
